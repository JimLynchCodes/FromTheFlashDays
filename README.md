# FromTheFlashDays
Past projects built in actionscript 3. They are Flash project that I developed on the side while working as a developer.

I am sorry, but you will not find any FlexUnit tests here. :'(. I have since realized the importance of unit tests and try to include them in all projects from now on. 

Take these projects for what they are. I don't reccommend using this code or even reading it really, but I sure had a blast writing it all. It does some pretty cool stuff, and developed my own simple MVC architecture and understanding of OOP concepts. 

Each folder in this root directory represents a projects. In an effort to keep it easier to find and read, I've put a description of each project here. 

### Avatar Chat
This is basically a fork off of the avatar chat project for the electroserver backend. Electroserver has since been bought out and privatised, but I keep this code around because it's a nice, clean example of a socket connection with a room of users. This project includes both the client side as3 code and the server side java code.
